### Session Overview
**Duration:** 4 hours
**Main Objective:** Research and plan Percy replacement initiative with odiff and Ember Puppeteer screenshot addon
**Success Rating:** 10/10 - "Felt like real pair today"

### What We Accomplished ✅
- Researched odiff as Percy replacement for visual regression testing
  - Analyzed odiff capabilities for image comparison
  - Evaluated integration options with CI/CD pipelines
  - Confirmed technical feasibility as Percy alternative
- Created GitHub Project for Percy replacement initiative (https://github.com/users/nicksteffens/projects/1) with 15 items
  - Structured project into actionable tasks
  - Organized workstreams for different integration paths
  - Created clear milestones and dependencies
- Analyzed fluid repo to validate Ember Puppeteer screenshot addon approach
  - Identified 56 Percy calls in fluid codebase
  - Confirmed testem already has remote debugging port configured
  - Validated Puppeteer connection strategy is viable
- Created GitHub issue in fluid repo for Percy replacement (https://github.com/movableink/fluid/issues/184)
  - Documented technical approach and rationale
  - Outlined migration strategy for existing Percy tests
  - Established fluid as proving ground for both Storybook and Ember migrations
- Decided on addon name: `ember-puppeteer-screenshot`
  - Verified package name available on npm
  - Chose specific naming to reflect mechanism (Puppeteer-based)
  - Ensures clarity about implementation approach
- Set up public codemods repo (https://github.com/nicksteffens/codemods)
  - Added comprehensive README with directory structure documentation
  - Created blueprint templates for new codemods
  - Configured husky + commitlint for conventional commits enforcement
  - Organized existing codemods into framework directories (lodash/, mui/)
  - Planned future directories (percy/, ember/)

### Key Decisions Made
- **Addon naming:** `ember-puppeteer-screenshot` - specific to the mechanism used rather than generic
- **Codemods organization:** Framework-based directories (lodash/, mui/, percy/ planned, ember/ planned)
- **Proving ground strategy:** fluid repo will validate both Storybook (Storycap) and Ember (Puppeteer addon) migration paths
- **Documentation approach:** GitHub Pages not needed for codemods repo - README is sufficient for current needs

### Challenges Encountered 🔧
None reported

### Most Valuable Collaboration
Keeping context and double-checking references CC was using throughout the session - created feeling of genuine pair programming rather than assistant/user dynamic

### Key Insight
Maintaining conversation context and actively verifying references/sources creates significantly better collaboration experience and more accurate outcomes

### Follow-Up Items 📝
1. Create odiff GitHub Action (core infrastructure piece)
2. Create ember-puppeteer-screenshot addon
3. Create Percy migration codemods

### Role Distribution
**Human:** Provided strategic direction, validated technical approaches, gave real-time feedback on context and reference accuracy, confirmed naming decisions, assessed session quality
**Claude:** Researched odiff technical capabilities, created GitHub Project structure, analyzed fluid repo codebase, set up codemods repository infrastructure, configured tooling (husky/commitlint), organized existing codemods, created documentation

### Success Factors
The session achieved a perfect 10/10 rating due to:
- Consistent context awareness throughout 4-hour session
- Active verification of references and sources rather than assumptions
- Collaborative decision-making on technical naming and organization
- Productive research and planning across multiple repositories
- Genuine pair programming dynamic where both parties contributed meaningfully
- Clear documentation of decisions and rationale for future reference
