- **Research & Planning**
  - Found existing issue #447 for ESLint plugin feature
  - Added detailed implementation plan with auto-detection approach
  - Researched ESLint plugin structure by examining eslint-plugin-react-hooks locally
  - Decided on exclusions-based config (list what NOT to lint vs what to lint)

- **ESLint Plugin Implementation**
  - Created `eslint-plugin/` directory structure
  - Built custom rule `no-deprecated-grid` that detects deprecated Grid v1 imports
  - Created recommended config enabling the rule
  - Set up TypeScript build with separate tsconfig
  - Added `@types/eslint` dev dependency

- **Package Integration**
  - Added exports for `@movable/ui/eslint-plugin` in package.json
  - Created `build:eslint-plugin` script using tsc

## 2025-12-08

### Session Overview
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Main Objective:** Implement ESLint plugin as npm workspace package (fresh start after failed subpath export approach)
**Success Rating:** 9/10

### What We Accomplished ✅

**Reverted Previous Failed Approach**
- Created PR #498 to revert all eslint-plugin commits from main (f879e569 to 476fc1eb)
- Reason: Subpath export approach (`@movable/ui/eslint-plugin`) doesn't work because ESLint expects `@scope/eslint-plugin-name` format
- Documented learnings in PR #491 session notes comment
- PR merged to clean up main

**Implemented npm Workspace Approach (UI Repo)**
- Created PR #499 with new workspace-based architecture
- Created `eslint-plugin-ui/` as standalone npm workspace package
- Package name: `@movable/eslint-plugin-ui`
- Features implemented:
  - `no-deprecated-grid` rule to disallow MUI Grid v1 imports
  - `recommended` config for easy consumption
  - TypeScript build with separate tsconfig
  - release-it configuration for publishing
  - GitHub Actions release workflow
- Added Storybook documentation page (`stories/ESLintPlugin.mdx`)
- Fixed markdown table rendering by adding `remark-gfm` to Storybook config
- Local testing via workspace dependency (`"@movable/eslint-plugin-ui": "*"`)

**Published to npm**
- Published `@movable/eslint-plugin-ui@1.0.0` with `npm publish --access public`

**Integrated into front-end-infra (Draft PR)**
- Created draft PR #10196 in front-end repo
- Added plugin as devDependency to studio package
- Updated `-base.eslintrc.cjs` to use `plugin:@movable/ui/recommended`
- Removed manual `no-restricted-imports` Grid rule (replaced by plugin)
- Added `@movable/eslint-plugin-ui` to dependabot daily checks
- Verified `yarn lint:src` catches deprecated Grid imports

### Key Decisions Made
- **Workspace approach over subpath exports**: ESLint plugin resolution requires standard package naming convention
- **Workspace dependency syntax**: Use `"*"` for local workspace packages (matches front-end patterns)
- **Recommended config**: Easier for consumers to adopt than individual rules

### Challenges Encountered 🔧
- User brought up the workspace `*` dependency approach after multiple loops of same approaches - this was the key insight that unlocked the solution

### Follow-Up Items 📝
- [ ] Merge UI PR #499
- [ ] Complete front-end draft PR #10196
- [ ] Add more rules to plugin as patterns emerge

- Fixed tests in `UserLinks.cy.tsx` to wrap with `UserBadgeProvider`

**Unset Toggle Fix (sc-172321)**
- Fixed toggle to reflect default value when clicking "Unset"
- Changed initial state from `row.enabled ?? false` to `row.enabled ?? row.default`
- Added `handleUnset` function that sets toggle to `row.default` before calling callback

**Indicator Icon Position (sc-172322)**
- Reordered feature flag columns: Name/Desc → Controls → Icon
- Changed from flex to fixed widths (150px controls, 40px icon) for tighter spacing
- Icon now appears immediately after the toggle switch

**User Reload on Flag Toggle (sc-178282)**
- Added `currentUser` and `currentUserV4` query invalidation to feature flag mutation
- When feature flags change, user data is refetched to reflect latest settings

**Trylink Display Improvement (sc-172324)**

## 2025-12-09

### Session Overview
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Main Objective:** Implement PATCH endpoint to clear trylink revisions (sc-172319 - Canvas trylinks don't clear out)
**Success Rating:** 9/10

### What We Accomplished ✅

**Backend Implementation (railsapp)**
- Created `update` action in `Api::V4::UsersController` to handle clearing trylink revisions
- Added route: `PATCH /api/v4/users/me`
- Accepts `{ revisions: { canvas: null } }` to clear specific revisions from session
- Returns updated user with fresh revision data
- Fixed session key naming bug (was `_revision_override`, should be `_revision` to match EmberApplication module)
- Added comprehensive controller specs (10 examples, 0 failures)
- Created draft PR #7861: https://github.com/movableink/movableink/pull/7861

**Frontend Implementation (front-end/packages/studio)**
- Created `useClearRevisions` mutation hook in `current-user.ts`
- Updated `ActiveAlert` component to use mutation instead of URL redirect
- Switched `DevToolsDialog` from `useAppData` to `useCurrentUserV4` for reactive updates
- Shows success/error snackbar feedback when clearing revisions
- Fixed component tests by adding `QueryClientProvider` wrapper
- All 4 DevTools component tests passing
- Created draft PR #10201: https://github.com/movableink/front-end/pull/10201

**Bug Discovery & Fix**
- Discovered session key mismatch between V4 controller (`_revision_override`) and EmberApplication module (`_revision`)
- This may have been contributing to the original bug where canvas trylinks don't clear out
- Fixed to use consistent `_revision` suffix across all session key references

### Challenges Encountered 🔧
- Session key naming inconsistency between V4 controller and EmberApplication module required investigation
- Component tests needed QueryClientProvider wrapper for new mutation hook
- Rubocop CI failure for empty line formatting (quickly fixed)

### Most Valuable Collaboration
Image pasting to explain what is happening - visual feedback helped quickly identify and debug issues

### Key Insight
The original bug may have been caused by a session key naming mismatch - the V4 controller was reading/writing to different session keys than the EmberApplication module.

### Follow-Up Items 📝
- [ ] Manually verify on staging with a Rails deploy

### Role Distribution
**Human:** Providing context, inspecting browsers for proper selectors, directing debugging approach, identifying the actual race condition issue
**Claude:** Executing test modifications as directed, creating commits and PR, documenting findings

### Honest Assessment
The 5/10 rating reflects the reality that user did most of the heavy lifting - Claude Code followed instructions but didn't independently solve the problem. The user's practical testing experience and browser inspection skills were the key factors in identifying and fixing the race condition.
