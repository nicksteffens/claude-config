### Session Overview
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Main Objective:** Audit and improve Shortcut workspace skills, create dual MCP configuration, and build epic update skill
**Success Rating:** 8/10

### What We Accomplished
- Configured dual Shortcut MCP servers (CoherentPath primary, Movable Ink legacy)
- Created `shortcut-workspaces` skill with static team/workflow references for both workspaces
- Updated skill-builder scaffold to create directory structure (`skill-name/SKILL.md`)
- Fixed skill_loader to support both directory and flat file formats
- Updated gitignore strategy: skills tracked by default, sensitive data excluded via `skills/.gitignore`
- Created `shortcut-epic-update` skill with external token config
- Implemented token management (`shortcut-tokens.json` gitignored, `shortcut-tokens.sample.json` committed)
- Wrote comprehensive tests for both skills (15/15 passing)
- Successfully tested creating epic in CoherentPath workspace and linking to objective
- Made 9 commits with proper conventional commit messages

### Challenges Encountered
- Initial confusion about skill directory structure (flat file vs directory format)
- JSON formatting issues with bash special characters (exclamation marks causing history expansion)
- Discovered Shortcut MCP doesn't support epic updates - built workaround skill with direct API calls

### Most Valuable Collaboration
Iterative refinement based on user feedback - particularly catching over-engineering (static values instead of dynamic queries, proper directory structure, separating sensitive tokens from skill code)

### Key Insight
Separating sensitive data (API tokens, team UUIDs) into gitignored files while keeping skill documentation and templates committed enables team sharing without exposing credentials. The `shortcut-tokens.json` + `shortcut-tokens.sample.json` pattern works well.

### Follow-Up Items
- [ ] Consider submitting PR to useshortcut/mcp-server-shortcut to add epic update support
- [ ] Push commits to origin when ready

### Role Distribution
**Human:** Directing - provided clear requirements, caught over-engineering early, guided design decisions
**Claude:** Implementation - wrote skills, tests, and infrastructure; iterated based on feedback

### Success Factors
Strong feedback loop prevented over-engineering. User caught issues early (wrong directory structure, hardcoded tokens, overly complex first drafts) which led to cleaner final implementation. Testing mindset throughout ensured quality.
