### Session Overview
**Duration:** 4 hours
**Main Objective:** Research and plan Percy replacement initiative with odiff and Ember Puppeteer screenshot addon
**Success Rating:** 10/10 - "Felt like real pair today"

### What We Accomplished ✅
- Researched odiff as Percy replacement for visual regression testing
  - Analyzed odiff capabilities for image comparison
  - Evaluated integration options with CI/CD pipelines
  - Confirmed technical feasibility as Percy alternative
- Created GitHub Project for Percy replacement initiative (https://github.com/users/nicksteffens/projects/1) with 15 items
  - Structured project into actionable tasks
  - Organized workstreams for different integration paths
  - Created clear milestones and dependencies
- Analyzed fluid repo to validate Ember Puppeteer screenshot addon approach
  - Identified 56 Percy calls in fluid codebase
  - Confirmed testem already has remote debugging port configured
  - Validated Puppeteer connection strategy is viable
- Created GitHub issue in fluid repo for Percy replacement (https://github.com/movableink/fluid/issues/184)
  - Documented technical approach and rationale
  - Outlined migration strategy for existing Percy tests
  - Established fluid as proving ground for both Storybook and Ember migrations
- Decided on addon name: `ember-puppeteer-screenshot`
  - Verified package name available on npm
  - Chose specific naming to reflect mechanism (Puppeteer-based)
  - Ensures clarity about implementation approach
- Set up public codemods repo (https://github.com/nicksteffens/codemods)
  - Added comprehensive README with directory structure documentation
  - Created blueprint templates for new codemods
  - Configured husky + commitlint for conventional commits enforcement
  - Organized existing codemods into framework directories (lodash/, mui/)
  - Planned future directories (percy/, ember/)

### Key Decisions Made
- **Addon naming:** `ember-puppeteer-screenshot` - specific to the mechanism used rather than generic
- **Codemods organization:** Framework-based directories (lodash/, mui/, percy/ planned, ember/ planned)
- **Proving ground strategy:** fluid repo will validate both Storybook (Storycap) and Ember (Puppeteer addon) migration paths
- **Documentation approach:** GitHub Pages not needed for codemods repo - README is sufficient for current needs

### Challenges Encountered 🔧
None reported

### Most Valuable Collaboration
Keeping context and double-checking references CC was using throughout the session - created feeling of genuine pair programming rather than assistant/user dynamic

### Key Insight
Maintaining conversation context and actively verifying references/sources creates significantly better collaboration experience and more accurate outcomes

### Follow-Up Items 📝
1. Create odiff GitHub Action (core infrastructure piece)
2. Create ember-puppeteer-screenshot addon
3. Create Percy migration codemods

### Role Distribution
**Human:** Provided strategic direction, validated technical approaches, gave real-time feedback on context and reference accuracy, confirmed naming decisions, assessed session quality
**Claude:** Researched odiff technical capabilities, created GitHub Project structure, analyzed fluid repo codebase, set up codemods repository infrastructure, configured tooling (husky/commitlint), organized existing codemods, created documentation

### Success Factors
The session achieved a perfect 10/10 rating due to:
- Consistent context awareness throughout 4-hour session
- Active verification of references and sources rather than assumptions
- Collaborative decision-making on technical naming and organization
- Productive research and planning across multiple repositories
- Genuine pair programming dynamic where both parties contributed meaningfully
- Clear documentation of decisions and rationale for future reference

### Session Overview
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Main Objective:** Migrate gist codemods, create npm-conventional-commits template, modernize action-append-deployed-revision-link, and plan Storybook PR Preview Action extraction
**Success Rating:** 9/10

### What We Accomplished ✅
- **Gist Migration**
  - Searched user's GitHub gists for codemods
  - Found and migrated `mountWithRouter → mountWithMixpanel` codemod to codemods repo (cypress/mount-with-router-to-mixpanel.js)
  - Deleted the migrated gist
- **Codemods Repo Cleanup**
  - Removed yarn.lock, standardized on npm (package-lock.json)
  - Confirmed .babelrc is needed for jscodeshift to parse TypeScript/React
- **npm-conventional-commits Template Repo**
  - Created new template repo: https://github.com/nicksteffens/npm-conventional-commits
  - Set up husky + commitlint for conventional commits
  - Marked as GitHub template for reuse
  - Added usage instructions to README
- **action-append-deployed-revision-link Modernization**
  - Created issues #15-18 for critical updates
  - Created PR #19 with all fixes:
    - Node runtime: node16 → node20
    - actions/checkout: v3 → v4
    - @actions/github: v5 → v6
    - @actions/core: v1.10 → v1.11
    - codeql-action: v2 → v3
  - Fixed security vulnerabilities, all tests passing
  - Created issue #20 for migrating to comment-based try-links
- **Storybook PR Preview Action Project**
  - Analyzed ui repo's storybook-pr-preview.yml workflow
  - Created GitHub Project #2: "Storybook PR Preview Action" (https://github.com/users/nicksteffens/projects/2)
  - Added 13 draft items for extraction work
  - Documented full analysis: extractable components (deploy, comment, cleanup), inputs, dependencies, improvements

### Challenges Encountered 🔧
A bit of hand-holding needed when using gh CLI commands - some confusion around command syntax and options

### Most Valuable Collaboration
Systematic approach to modernizing the GitHub Action with comprehensive issue tracking and testing

### Key Insight
GitHub project creation works without needing a repository - projects can exist at the user/organization level independently

### Follow-Up Items 📝
1. Complete review and merge PR #19 for action-append-deployed-revision-link
2. Begin extraction work on Storybook PR Preview Action using project plan
3. Consider migrating action-append-deployed-revision-link to comment-based try-links (issue #20)

### Role Distribution
**Human:** Provided assessment criteria, confirmed approach decisions, validated gh CLI usage patterns, directed work priorities
**Claude:** Migrated gist codemods, created template repository with conventional commits setup, modernized GitHub Action dependencies, analyzed workflow for extraction, created GitHub Project with detailed task breakdown

### Success Factors
The session achieved a 9/10 rating due to:
- Successful completion of multiple distinct objectives across different repositories
- Creation of reusable template repository for future npm projects
- Comprehensive modernization of GitHub Action with proper issue tracking
- Thorough analysis and planning for Storybook PR Preview Action extraction
- Good organization and documentation throughout
